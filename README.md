# Svelte Image Lightbox & Slider

Lightbox effect and image slider should be easy to use and should not require you to download large JQuery file or other third party libraries.

This example has two components. Component lightboxSlider has a big image and smaller images and clicking on the image opens the lightbox with the slider. The other one has only a slider. Coder only need to provide an array of images and title from the page which uses these modules.
